# Car Rental Management Project

## Description

This project is a car rental management application with a JavaFX user interface. It allows users to register, log in, browse available cars, and make reservations. Additionally, a dashboard is available for the administrator to manage users, reservations, and cars.

### Main Features:

1. **User Part**:
   - **Account Creation and Login**:
     - Users can create an account by filling out a secure registration form and log in through a dedicated login form.
   - **Car Reservation**:
     - Users can browse the list of available cars and reserve the one of their choice for a specific period.
     - A search bar allows filtering cars by criteria (model, price, etc.).

2. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - **Car Management**:
     - The administrator can add, modify, or remove cars from the system, updating details such as model, rental price, and availability.
   - **User Management**:
     - The dashboard allows the administrator to view the list of registered users and manage their accounts.
   - **Reservation Management**:
     - The administrator can view and manage reservations made by users.
   - **Statistics and Reports**:
     - The dashboard provides statistics on reservations and the most popular cars.

### Technologies Used:

- **JavaFX**: For the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application, providing modern features for building desktop applications.
- **MySQL/SQLite**: For managing the database of users, cars, and reservations.
- **Git**: For source code and version control.
